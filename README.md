# About

Gedeair Backend is a RESTful API designed to serve as the backend for a tabletop role-playing game (RPG) system, known in French as a "Jeu de RÃ´le" (JDR), which is where the name Gedeair originates. The system provides essential features for managing game mechanics, player interactions, character data, and more, allowing Game Masters and players to focus on the experience without worrying about technicalities. Built with performance and scalability in mind, Gedeair Backend is a solution for both small games and large campaigns.
